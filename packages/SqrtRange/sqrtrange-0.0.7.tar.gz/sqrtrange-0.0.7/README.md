# SqrtRange
SqrtRange is a simple python library used to generate Square root of numbers in a certain range.

This *can* be helpful, but not always (obviously :skull:)

# Installation

Here are the two main ways to install this module

`python -m pip install SqrtRange`

`pip install SqrtRange`

This uses native python modules, so no depedencies are required :D

# Documentation
It's actually really simple

Here is what you can use:

`SqrtRange.CalculateWOLogging(firstnumber, secondnumber, doTimeTaken)`

`SqrtRange.Calculate(firstnumber, secondnumber, logFile, doClearLogFile, doTimeTaken)`

Firstnumber and Secondnumber are **integers**, these will indicate the range

LogFile is a **string**, it's where to log the numbers to

doClearLogFile instead is a **boolean**, it's used if you want to clear the log file or not

doClearLogFile is a **boolean**, it's used if you to measure the time and the actual successfull numbers calculated or not
