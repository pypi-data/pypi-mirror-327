### **Why GhostData?**  
Every time you share a **photo, PDF, video, or audio file**, you might be sharing **more than you think**. Hidden inside your files is **metadata**—information like:  
✔ **Your location (GPS coordinates from photos & videos)**  
✔ **Device details (camera model, software version, recording device info)**  
✔ **Timestamps (when and where the file was created/edited)**  
✔ **Author names & hidden document history in PDFs**  
✔ **Hidden media properties in audio & video files**  

This data can be **misused**, exposing personal details or even tracking your movements. **GhostData** ensures your files are **clean, anonymous, and safe to share.**

### **How GhostData Works**  
GhostData is a **lightweight, easy-to-use SDK** that removes metadata from:  
✅ **Images (JPEG, PNG)** – Strips GPS, camera details, and timestamps.  
✅ **PDFs** – Wipes out hidden author names, document history, and more.  
✅ **Videos (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV)** – Removes GPS data, timestamps, and embedded creator info.  
✅ **Audio Files (MP3)** – Clears hidden tags, author names, and unnecessary metadata.  

💡 **Your files stay local** – No uploads, no tracking, just **instant privacy.**
