"""
Module for managing Streamlit session state using descriptors and a metaclass.

This module provides a mechanism to automatically bind class attributes (defined via
type annotations) to Streamlit's session state. It leverages the `SessionVar` descriptor to
synchronize attribute values with the session state and the `MetaSessionState` metaclass to
ensure that instances are uniquely stored and retrieved based on a session key.
