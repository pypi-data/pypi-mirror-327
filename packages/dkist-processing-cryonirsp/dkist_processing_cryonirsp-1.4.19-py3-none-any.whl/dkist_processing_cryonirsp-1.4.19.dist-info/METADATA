dkist-processing-cryonirsp
==========================

Overview
--------
The dkist-processing-cryonirsp library contains the implementation of the cryonirsp pipelines as a collection of the
`dkist-processing-core <https://pypi.org/project/dkist-processing-core/>`_ framework and
`dkist-processing-common <https://pypi.org/project/dkist-processing-common/>`_ Tasks.

The recommended project structure is to separate tasks and workflows into separate packages.  Having the workflows
in their own package facilitates using the build_utils to test the integrity of those workflows in the unit test.

Calibration Pipeline
------------------------

Build
-----
Artifacts are built through Bitbucket Pipelines.

The pipeline can be used in other repos with a modification of the package and artifact locations
to use the names relevant to the target repo.

e.g. dkist-processing-test -> dkist-processing-vbi and dkist_processing_test -> dkist_processing_vbi

Deployment
----------
Deployment is done with `turtlebot <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/turtlebot/src/main/>`_ and follows
the process detailed in `dkist-processing-core <https://pypi.org/project/dkist-processing-core/>`_

Environment Variables
---------------------
Only those specified by `dkist-processing-core <https://pypi.org/project/dkist-processing-core/>`_ and `dkist-processing-common <https://pypi.org/project/dkist-processing-common/>`_.

Development
-----------
.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@bitbucket.org:dkistdc/dkist-processing-cryonirsp.git
    cd dkist-processing-cryonirsp
    pre-commit install
    pip install -e .[test]
    pytest -v --cov dkist_processing_cryonirsp

Changelog
#########

When you make **any** change to this repository it **MUST** be accompanied by a changelog file.
The changelog for this repository uses the `towncrier <https://github.com/twisted/towncrier>`__ package.
Entries in the changelog for the next release are added as individual files (one per change) to the ``changelog/`` directory.

Writing a Changelog Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A changelog entry accompanying a change should be added to the ``changelog/`` directory.
The name of a file in this directory follows a specific template::

  <PULL REQUEST NUMBER>.<TYPE>[.<COUNTER>].rst

The fields have the following meanings:

* ``<PULL REQUEST NUMBER>``: This is the number of the pull request, so people can jump from the changelog entry to the diff on BitBucket.
* ``<TYPE>``: This is the type of the change and must be one of the values described below.
* ``<COUNTER>``: This is an optional field, if you make more than one change of the same type you can append a counter to the subsequent changes, i.e. ``100.bugfix.rst`` and ``100.bugfix.1.rst`` for two bugfix changes in the same PR.

The list of possible types is defined in the towncrier section of ``pyproject.toml``, the types are:

* ``feature``: This change is a new code feature.
* ``bugfix``: This is a change which fixes a bug.
* ``doc``: A documentation change.
* ``removal``: A deprecation or removal of public API.
* ``misc``: Any small change which doesn't fit anywhere else, such as a change to the package infrastructure.


Rendering the Changelog at Release Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you are about to tag a release first you must run ``towncrier`` to render the changelog.
The steps for this are as follows:

* Run `towncrier build --version vx.y.z` using the version number you want to tag.
* Agree to have towncrier remove the fragments.
* Add and commit your changes.
* Tag the release.

**NOTE:** If you forget to add a Changelog entry to a tagged release (either manually or automatically with ``towncrier``)
then the Bitbucket pipeline will fail. To be able to use the same tag you must delete it locally and on the remote branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    # First, actually update the CHANGELOG and commit the update
    git commit

    # Delete tags
    git tag -d vWHATEVER.THE.VERSION
    git push --delete origin vWHATEVER.THE.VERSION

    # Re-tag with the same version
    git tag vWHATEVER.THE.VERSION
    git push --tags origin main

Science Changelog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whenever a release involves changes to the scientific quality of L1 data, additional changelog fragment(s) should be
created. These fragments are intended to be as verbose as is needed to accurately capture the scope of the change(s),
so feel free to use all the fancy RST you want. Science fragments are placed in the same ``changelog/`` directory
as other fragments, but are always called::

  <PR NUMBER | +>.science[.<COUNTER>].rst

In the case that a single pull request encapsulates the entirety of the scientific change then the first field should
be that PR number (same as the normal CHANGELOG). If, however, there is not a simple mapping from a single PR to a scientific
change then use the character "+" instead; this will create a changelog entry with no associated PR. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ls changelog/
  99.bugfix.rst    # This is a normal changelog fragment associated with a bugfix in PR 99
  99.science.rst   # Apparently that bugfix also changed the scientific results, so that PR also gets a science fragment
  +.science.rst    # This fragment is not associated with a PR


When it comes time to build the SCIENCE_CHANGELOG, use the ``science_towncrier.sh`` script in this repo to do so.
This script accepts all the same arguments as the default `towncrier`. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./science_towncrier.sh build --version vx.y.z

This will update the SCIENCE_CHANGELOG and remove any science fragments from the changelog directory.
