              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

![Logo](docs/_static/logo_paidiver_docs.png)

**Paidiverpy** is a Python package designed to create pipelines for preprocessing image data for biodiversity analysis.

> **Note:** This package is still in active development, and frequent updates and changes are expected. The API and features may evolve as we continue improving it.


## Documentation

The official documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs.org: https://paidiverpy.readthedocs.io/

> **Note:** Comprehensive documentation is under construction.

## Installation

To install paidiverpy, run:

 ```bash
pip install paidiverpy
 ```

### Build from Source

You can install `paidiverpy` locally or on a notebook server such as JASMIN or the NOC Data Science Platform (DSP). The following steps are applicable to both environments, but steps 2 and 3 are required if you are using a notebook server.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   # ssh
   git clone git@github.com:paidiver/paidiverpy.git

   # https
   # git clone https://github.com/paidiver/paidiverpy.git

   cd paidiverpy
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies separately from other projects. For example, using `conda`:

   ```bash
   conda init

   # Command to restart the terminal. This command may not be necessary if mamba init has already been successfully run before
   exec bash

   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate Paidiverpy
   ```

3. (Optional) For JASMIN or DSP users, you also need to install the environment in the Jupyter IPython kernel. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name Paidiverpy
   ```

4. Install the paidiverpy package:

   Finally, you can install the paidiverpy package:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Package Organisation

### Configuration File

First, create a configuration file. Example configuration files for processing the sample datasets are available in the `example/config` directory. You can use these files to test the example notebooks described in the [Usage section](#usage). Note that running the examples will automatically download the sample data.

The configuration file should follow the JSON schema described in the [configuration file schema](src/paidiverpy/configuration-schema.json). An online tool to validate configuration files is available [here](https://paidiver.github.io/paidiverpy/config_check.html).

### Metadata

To use this package, you may need a metadata file, which can be an IFDO.json file (following the IFDO standard) or a CSV file. For CSV files, ensure the `filename` column uses one of the following headers: `['image-filename', 'filename', 'file_name', 'FileName', 'File Name']`.

Other columns like datetime, latitude, and longitude should follow these conventions:

- Datetime: `['image-datetime', 'datetime', 'date_time', 'DateTime', 'Datetime']`
- Latitude: `['image-latitude', 'lat', 'latitude_deg', 'latitude', 'Latitude', 'Latitude_deg', 'Lat']`
- Longitude: `['image-longitude', 'lon', 'longitude_deg', 'longitude', 'Longitude', 'Longitude_deg', 'Lon']`

Examples of CSV and IFDO metadata files are in the `example/metadata` directory.

### Layers

The package is organised into multiple layers:

![Package Organisation](docs/_static/paidiver_organisation.jpg)

The `Paidiverpy` class serves as the main container for image processing functions. It manages several subclasses for specific processing tasks: `OpenLayer`, `ConvertLayer`, `PositionLayer`, `ResampleLayer`, and `ColourLayer`.

Supporting classes include:

- `Configuration`: Parses and manages configuration files.
- `Metadata`: Handles metadata.
- `ImagesLayer`: Stores outputs from each image processing step.

The `Pipeline` class integrates all processing steps defined in the configuration file.

## Usage

While comprehensive documentation is forthcoming, you can explore various use cases through sample notebooks in the `examples/example_notebooks` directory:

- [Open and display a configuration file and a metadata file](examples/example_notebooks/config_metadata_example.ipynb)
- [Run processing steps without creating a pipeline](examples/example_notebooks/simple_processing.ipynb)
- [Run a pipeline and interact with outputs](examples/example_notebooks/pipeline.ipynb)
- [Run pipeline steps in test mode](examples/example_notebooks/pipeline_testing_steps.ipynb)
- [Create pipelines programmatically](examples/example_notebooks/pipeline_generation.ipynb)
- [Rerun pipeline steps with modified configurations](examples/example_notebooks/pipeline_interaction.ipynb)
- [Use parallelization with Dask](examples/example_notebooks/pipeline_dask.ipynb)
- [Create a LocalCluster and run a pipeline](examples/example_notebooks/pipeline_cluster.ipynb)
- [Run a pipeline using a public dataset with IFDO metadata](examples/example_notebooks/pipeline_ifdo.ipynb)
- [Run a pipeline using a data on a object store](examples/example_notebooks/pipeline_remote_data.ipynb)
- [Add a custom algorithm to a pipeline](examples/example_notebooks/pipeline_custom_algorithm.ipynb)

### Example Data

If you'd like to manually download example data for testing, you can use the following command:

```python
from paidiverpy import data
data.load(DATASET_NAME)
```

Available datasets:

- pelagic_csv
- benthic_csv
- benthic_ifdo

Example data will be automatically downloaded when running the example notebooks.

### Command-Line Arguments

Pipelines can be executed via command-line arguments. For example:

```bash
paidiverpy -c examples/config_files/config_simple.yaml
```

This runs the pipeline according to the configuration file, saving output images to the directory defined in the `output_path`.

## Docker

You can run **Paidiverpy** using Docker by either building the container locally or pulling a pre-built image from **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** or **Docker Hub**.

### Build or Pull the Docker Image

You have three options to obtain the Paidiverpy Docker image:

#### **Option 1: Build the container locally**
Clone the repository and build the image:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:paidiver/paidiverpy.git
cd paidiverpy
docker build -t paidiverpy .
```

#### **Option 2: Pull from Docker Hub**
Fetch the latest image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull soutobias/paidiverpy:latest
docker tag soutobias/paidiverpy:latest paidiverpy:latest
```

#### **Option 3: Pull from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**
Fetch the latest image from GitHub:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/paidiver/paidiverpy:latest
docker tag ghcr.io/paidiver/paidiverpy:latest paidiverpy:latest
```

### Running the Container

To run the container with local input, output, and metadata directories, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v <INPUT_PATH>:/app/input/ \
  -v <OUTPUT_PATH>:/app/output/ \
  -v <METADATA_PATH>:/app/metadata/ \
  -v <CONFIG_DIR>:/app/config_files/ \
  paidiverpy -c /app/examples/config_files/<CONFIG_FILE>
```

#### **Arguments Explained**
- `<INPUT_PATH>`: Local directory containing input images (as defined in the configuration file).
- `<OUTPUT_PATH>`: Local directory where processed images will be saved.
- `<METADATA_PATH>`: Local directory containing the metadata file.
- `<CONFIG_DIR>`: Local directory containing the configuration file.
- `<CONFIG_FILE>`: Name of the configuration file.

The processed images will be saved in the `output_path` specified in the configuration file.

### Running with Remote Data (Object Store)

If your input data is stored remotely (e.g., in an object store), you **do not** need to mount local volumes for input data. However, to upload processed images to an object store, you must provide authentication credentials via an environment file.

Use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v <CONFIG_DIR>:/app/config_files/ \
  --env-file .env \
  paidiverpy -c /app/examples/config_files/<CONFIG_FILE>
```

#### **Environment File (`.env`)**
Create a `.env` file with your object store credentials:

```bash
OS_SECRET=your_secret
OS_TOKEN=your_token
OS_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
```

This will allow Paidiverpy to authenticate and interact with the remote storage system.
