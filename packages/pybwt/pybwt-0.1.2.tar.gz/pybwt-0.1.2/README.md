# PyBWT: A Burrows-Wheeler Transform Tool

PyBWT is a Python implementation of the **Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)** for efficient text compression and pattern searching. It supports:
- **Constructing the BWT** of a given text.
- **Reversing the BWT** to recover an original text.
- **Efficient occurrence counting** using the FM-index (Backward Search).

## üìå Features
‚úÖ Compute the **Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)** of a string.  
‚úÖ **Invert the BWT** to recover the original text.  
‚úÖ **Search for substrings** efficiently without reconstructing the original text.  
‚úÖ Uses **suffix arrays** and **LF-mapping** for fast operations.

## ‚å®Ô∏è User Guide/Documentation
The tool is relatively simple at the moment and functions largely through the BWT_Container class.
For a simple example, please visit the project's git repo.
Additional documentation will be created shortly.
