# HTTPLite: A Singleton HTTP Client for Enhanced Web Interaction
#
# Overview:
# HTTPLite is engineered to support advanced web interaction and scraping activities,
# employing a singleton design to ensure a single coherent point of operation throughout
# the application lifecycle. This class encapsulates sophisticated features such as
# automatic user-agent rotation, managed request delays, and header randomization,
# designed to optimize network interactions for both efficiency and discretion.
#
# Key Features:
# - Persistent HTTP sessions with configurable request headers for consistent interactions.
# - Dynamic user-agent rotation to simulate requests from various environments.
# - Delay management between requests to emulate human browsing patterns and avoid detection.
# - Header shuffling to prevent pattern recognition by server-side security systems.
#
# Usage:
# This class is intended for use in scenarios where typical HTTP clients fall short, such as
# data scraping, automated interactions with APIs, or when managing a large volume of requests
# that require careful pacing and obfuscation to maintain access to target resources.
#
# Implementation Note:
# HTTPLite utilizes the `requests` library for underlying HTTP communication, ensuring broad
# compatibility and reliability. Ensure the singleton instance is properly managed to avoid
# unwanted re-initialization or resource leaks.

class HTTPLite:
    """
    HTTPLite is a singleton-pattern HTTP client tailored for sophisticated HTTP interactions, ideal for
    automated web interactions and web scraping tasks where mimicry of human browser behavior is essential.
    It handles persistent HTTP sessions with a focus on header management, request throttling, and user-agent rotation,
    optimizing for both performance and stealth in high-demand scenarios.

    The class leverages a requests.Session object to maintain connection pooling and header persistence across requests,
    ensuring efficiency and consistency in the communication with web services. Features like header shuffling and
    randomized request delays are specifically designed to obscure the non-human origin of the requests, thereby
    reducing the likelihood of detection and blocking by web servers.

    Attributes:
        base_url (str): Base URL to which the HTTPLite client directs all its requests. This is a foundational attribute that sets the scope of operations for HTTP interactions.
        host (str): The network host extracted from the base_url. This is crucial for optimizing connection reuse and for context-specific request handling.
        last_request_time (float): Timestamp of the last executed request, used to manage request pacing and ensure compliance with rate limits or courtesy policies.
        session (requests.Session): Configured session object which holds and manages persistent connections and state across multiple requests.
        initialized (bool): A boolean flag indicating whether the HTTPLite instance has completed its initialization, ensuring it's ready for operation.

    Methods:
        update_base_url(new_url): Set a new base URL, adapting the client's target endpoint and associated network host, enabling dynamic adjustment to changing server configurations or API endpoints.
        findhost(url): Derive the host component from a URL, crucial for extracting and managing the network layer of the URL structure.
        random_delay(): Implements a strategically randomized delay between consecutive requests to the same host, simulating human-like interaction patterns and aiding in avoiding automated access patterns detection.
        shuffle_headers(): Randomizes the sequence of HTTP headers in requests to further simulate the non-deterministic header order typical in browser-generated HTTP traffic.
        update_header(key, value): Provides the capability to dynamically adjust HTTP headers, facilitating context-specific tuning of requests, such as modifying user-agent or content-type headers in response to server requirements.
        get_headers(key=None): Retrieves currently configured headers, supporting both complete retrieval and lookup for specific header values, which is vital for debugging and compliance verification.
        make_request(params): Executes a prepared HTTP request considering all configured optimizations like base URL, header shuffling, and enforced delays, tailored to handle both typical and complex request scenarios.
        destroy_instance(): Deactivates the singleton instance of HTTPLite, effectively cleaning up resources and resetting the class state to prevent misuse or resource leakage in a controlled shutdown process.
