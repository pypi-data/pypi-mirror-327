# README: vm-pkg-tools

## Overview

`vm-pkg-tools` is a Python package designed to facilitate parsing scout files for volleyball analytics. This document outlines the process to build, test, and deploy the package, as well as instructions to use it effectively.

└── dist/
```

## Requirements

### Runtime Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for the package to run:

- `click>=8.1,<9.0`
- `pydantic>=2.0,<3.0`
- `sqlalchemy>=2.0,<3.0`
- `PyYAML>=6.0,<7.0`
- `unidecode>=1.3,<2.0`
- `chardet>=5.0,<6.0`
- `colorlog>=6.0,<7.0`

### Development and Testing Dependencies

For local testing and development, include:

- `black>=24.10`
- `flake8>=7.1`
- `isort>=5.13`
- `pylint>=3.3`
- `pytest>=8.3.4`
- `attrs>=24.3`
- `twine`
- `setuptools`

---

## Installation

### Install Locally for Testing

1. Build the package:

   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```

2. Install the package in a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv test_env
   source test_env/bin/activate
   pip install dist/vm_pkg_tools-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

3. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   vmtools-cli --help
   ```

---

## Usage

### Parsing a Scout File

Ensure that the `data/scouts/` directory exists and contains the required scout file:

```bash
vmtools-cli parse data/scouts/&1003.dvw
```

---

## Testing the Package

1. Create a fresh virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv test_env
   source test_env/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the built package:

   ```bash
   pip install dist/vm_pkg_tools-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

3. Run commands to verify functionality:

   ```bash
   vmtools-cli parse data/scouts/&1003.dvw
   ```

4. Run tests:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

---

## Deployment

1. Remove old build artifacts:

   ```bash
   rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info
   ```

2. Build the package:

   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```

3. Upload to PyPI:

   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

4. Verify the package on PyPI:
   [PyPI Project Page](https://pypi.org/project/vm-pkg-tools/)

---

## Versioning

### Tagging a Release

After testing and deploying, tag the release for version tracking:

```bash
git tag v<version>
git push origin v<version>
```

---

## Common Issues

### Missing Dependencies

If a dependency is missing during testing, add it to `install_requires` in `setup.py` and rebuild the package.

### File Not Found Errors

Ensure the required files are not ignored by `.gitignore` and exist in the expected directories.

### Import Errors

Verify all imports use the correct relative paths and update `PYTHONPATH` if necessary.

---

## How to Run the Parser Directly

If you want to run the parser via the command line (without installing the package), you can use the following approaches:

### 1) Direct Script Execution

- Navigate to your project's root folder.

- Run the script:

  ```bash
  python src/vm_pkg_tools/core/main.py --input_file "data/scouts/&1003.dvw" --output_file "output.json"
  ```

  This approach relies on the relative paths set up in your code. If you run into import errors, you may need to modify your `PYTHONPATH` or run from the `src` directory.

### 2) Using PYTHONPATH

Alternatively, if you prefer referencing modules as installed packages:

- From your project's root:

  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=src python -m vm_pkg_tools.core.main \
      --input_file "data/scouts/&1003.dvw" \
      --output_file "output.json"
  ```

This sets your `src` folder as the root package directory, then runs the `main.py` script under the `vm_pkg_tools.core` module.
