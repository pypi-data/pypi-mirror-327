# aiolibs-executor

Asyncio version of `concurrent.futures` executor.

## Installaion

`pip install aiolibs-executor`

## Usage

```
from aiolibs_executor import Executor

async def worker(arg):
   return await do_stuff(arg)

async with Executor(num_workers=3) as executor:
	futs = [await executor.submit(worker(i)) for i in range(10)]
	for fut in futs:
