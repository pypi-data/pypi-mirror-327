`quangpy` mainly provides Joint Scale Analysis and Variance Decomposition Analysis.

## Installation

```bash
pip install quangpy

```

## Getting Started

### input data format

The input file should be separated by tab and provide the following columns in the same order:

- population: population name
- mean: mean of the population phenotype
- var: variance of the population phenotype

The following is an example of the input data format:

|     | mean  | var      |
| --- | ----- | -------- |
| b1l | 7.5   | 0.010000 |
| b1s | 5.575 | 0.004096 |
| f1  | 5.5   | 0.007396 |
| f2  | 6.595 | 0.013924 |
| p1  | 9.125 | 0.008281 |
| p2  | 5.475 | 0.003249 |

### Joint Scale Analysis

```python
from quangpy import JointScale

input_data = "/path/to/input/data"

js = JointScale(input_data)
js.fit(("m", "a"))

```

### Variance Decomposition Analysis

```python
from quangpy import VarianceDecomposition

input_data = "/path/to/input/data"
vd = VarianceDecomposition(input_data)
vd.fit(("m", "a", "d", "aa", "dd"))
```
