chat_history = [
    {"role": "User", "message": "hello world"},
    {"role": "Chatbot", "message": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"}
]

response = await AkenoXToJs.randydev(
    "ai/cohere/command-plus",
    api_key="<your_api_key>",
    custom_dev_fast=True,
    query="what is AkenoX AI?",
    chatHistory=json.dumps(chat_history),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant designed to provide clear and concise responses."

>
> Always use <b>rate limiting</b>
>
```py
from akenoai import AkenoXToJs as js
from akenoai.runner import run_fast

app = js.get_app()

@app.get("/api/cohere")
async def cohere(query: str):
    return await js.randydev(
        "ai/cohere/command-plus",
        api_key="<your_api_key>",
        custom_dev_fast=True,
        query=query,
        chatHistory=[],
        system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant designed to provide clear and concise responses."
    )

@app.get("/test")
async def example_json():
    async with js.fasthttp().ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1") as response:
            title = js.dict_to_obj(await response.json()).title
    return {"message": title}

run_fast(build=app)
```
### ü•∑ Full-Stack Examples
- [X] Powerful & Super Fast Performance
- [X] Recommended RAM: 8GB / 16GB

```py
import logging
from akenoai import AkenoXToJs as js
from akenoai.runner import run_fast

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
LOGS = logging.getLogger("[akenox]")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

app = js.get_app()
js.add_cors_middleware()

client = js.create_pyrogram(
    ":memory",
    api_id=1234,
    api_hash="asdfghkl",
    session_string="session"
)

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    user = await client.start()
    LOGS.info(f"Started UserBot: {user.me.first_name}")

@app.get("/api/cohere")
async def cohere(query: str):
    return await js.randydev(
        "ai/cohere/command-plus",
        api_key="<your_api_key>",
        custom_dev_fast=True,
        query=query,
        chatHistory=[],
        system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant designed to provide clear and concise responses."
    )

@app.get("/test")
async def example_json():
    async with js.fasthttp().ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1") as response:
            title = js.dict_to_obj(await response.json()).title
    return {"message": title}

@app.get("/api/send_message")
async def send_message(text: str, chat_id: str):
    response_json = await client.send_message(chat_id, text)
    return {"success": response_json}

run_fast(build=app)
```

- Use API Key V1 Free
```py
from akenoai import AkenoXToJs

response = await AkenoXToJs.randydev(
    "ai/openai/gpt-old",
     custom_dev_fast=True,
     query="hello world"
)
