### installation
🔹 <b>Recommended Installation:</b>

✅ Install via [`PYPI`](https://pypi.org/project/akenoai) for the latest updates. e.g.: `pip3 install akenoai[fast]`

✅ Install via github
- Create a requirements.txt file in the project root containing the following dependency to ensure you can install the GitHub version:
- `git+https://github.com/TeamKillerX/akenoai-lib.git#egg=akenoai[fast]`

### FastAPI Demo
- Use `main.py`
- Try running `python3 main.py`
```py
from akenoai.runner import run_fast

# run_fast initializes a FastAPI server with example routes and configurations.

run_fast()
```

### Code examples
> [!TIP]
> Trip PRO Usage Example:

- Use Access API key V2 Premium
```py
import json
from akenoai import AkenoXToJs

chat_history = [
    {"role": "User", "message": "hello world"},
    {"role": "Chatbot", "message": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"}
]

response = await AkenoXToJs.randydev(
    "ai/cohere/command-plus",
    api_key="<your_api_key>",
    custom_dev_fast=True,
    query="what is AkenoX AI?",
    chatHistory=json.dumps(chat_history),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant designed to provide clear and concise responses."
)

print(response)
```
### 🚀 Super-Fast Performance
Use AkenoX-API + FastAPI
> [!WARNING]
> AkenoX API <b>may block access if there are too many spam requests!</b> 🚨
>
> Always use <b>rate limiting</b>
>
```py
from akenoai import AkenoXToJs as js
from akenoai.runner import run_fast

app = js.get_app()

@app.get("/api/cohere")
async def cohere(query: str):
    return await js.randydev(
        "ai/cohere/command-plus",
        api_key="<your_api_key>",
        custom_dev_fast=True,
        query=query,
        chatHistory=[],
        system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant designed to provide clear and concise responses."
    )

@app.get("/test")
async def example_json():
    async with js.fasthttp().ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1") as response:
            title = js.dict_to_obj(await response.json()).title
    return {"message": title}

run_fast(build=app)
```
### 🥷 Full-Stack Examples
- [X] Powerful & Super Fast Performance
- [X] Recommended RAM: 8GB / 16GB
- [X] Supports `bot_token` & `session_string`
- [X] Custom Web Frontend with HTML & CSS
```py
import logging
from akenoai import AkenoXToJs as js
from akenoai.runner import run_fast

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
LOGS = logging.getLogger("[akenox]")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

app = js.get_app()
js.add_cors_middleware()

client = js.create_pyrogram(
    ":memory",
    api_id=1234,
    api_hash="asdfghkl",
    session_string="session"
)

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    user = await client.start()
    LOGS.info(f"Started UserBot: {user.me.first_name}")

@app.get("/api/cohere")
async def cohere(query: str):
    return await js.randydev(
        "ai/cohere/command-plus",
        api_key="<your_api_key>",
        custom_dev_fast=True,
        query=query,
        chatHistory=[],
        system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant designed to provide clear and concise responses."
    )

@app.get("/test")
async def example_json():
    async with js.fasthttp().ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1") as response:
            title = js.dict_to_obj(await response.json()).title
    return {"message": title}

@app.get("/api/send_message")
async def send_message(text: str, chat_id: str):
    response_json = await client.send_message(chat_id, text)
    return {"success": response_json}

run_fast(build=app)
```

- Use API Key V1 Free
```py
from akenoai import AkenoXToJs

response = await AkenoXToJs.randydev(
    "ai/openai/gpt-old",
     custom_dev_fast=True,
     query="hello world"
)
print(response)
```
<b>Output:</b>
```py
{'results': 'Deepseek is a Chinese company that specializes in underwater robotics and autonomous underwater vehicles. They provide solutions for underwater exploration and research, as well as services for inspecting and maintaining underwater infrastructure. Their technology is used in various industries including marine science, aquaculture, and offshore energy.\n\nPowered By xtdevs'}
```
🔹 <b>Method Definition:</b>
```py
randydev(endpoint, api_key=None, post=False, custom_dev_fast=False, **params)
```
🔹 <b>User Creation Date:</b>
```py
import os
from akenoai import AkenoXToJs

response = await AkenoXToJs.randydev(
    "user/creation-date",
    custom_dev_fast=True,
    user_id=client.me.id
)
return response
```
