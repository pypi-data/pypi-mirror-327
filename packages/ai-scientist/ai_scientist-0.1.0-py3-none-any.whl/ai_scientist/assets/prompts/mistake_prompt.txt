Your previous response was invalid. Please ensure you provide a well-structured JSON object with the following format:

{
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "read",
      "fp": "FILE_PATH"
    },
    {
      "action": "write",
      "fp": "FILE_PATH",
      "content": "CONTENT"
    },
    {
      "action": "run",
      "script": "BASH_SCRIPT",
      "tl": TIME_LIMIT  // Optional
    },
    {
      "action": "to_human",
      "question": "QUESTION"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "A brief summary of the actions taken and the current state of the research."
}

Ensure that:
- You only include valid actions as described and a `summary` field.
- The JSON is properly formatted.
- After specifying your actions and summary, end your generation.
- Remember, even for a simply reply or clarification, you need to output a JSON and use the action "to_human".
