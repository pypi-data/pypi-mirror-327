Dependence provides a Command Line Interface and library for aligning
a python projects' declared dependencies with the package versions
installed in the environment in which `dependence` is executed, and for
"freezing" recursively resolved package dependencies (like `pip freeze`, but
for a package, instead of the entire environment).

## Installation

You can install `dependence` with pip:

```shell
pip3 install dependence
```

## Example Usage

### Listing Dependencies

The `dependence freeze` command, and the `dependence.freeze.freeze` function,
print all requirements for one or more specified python project,
requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, or tox.ini files. The output
format matches that of `pip freeze`, but only lists dependencies of indicated
packages and/or editable project locations.

You may refer to the [`dependence freeze` CLI reference](https://dependence.enorganic.org/cli/#dependence-freeze)
and/or [`dependence.freeze` API reference](https://dependence.enorganic.org/api/freeze/) for details
concerning this command/module, related options, and more complex use case
examples.

We'll use this project, `dependence`, as a simple example. To start with, let's
see what the currently installed dependencies for this package look like
at the time of writing:

```console
$ dependence freeze .
packaging==24.1
pip==24.3.0
setuptools==75.1.0
tomli==2.1.0
tomli_w==1.0.0
```

...now let's save this output for later comparison purposes:

```bash
dependence freeze . > requirements_before.txt
```

Now, we'll upgrade our dependencies and see what they look like after:

```console
$ pip install -q --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager . && dependence freeze .
packaging==24.2
pip==24.3.1
setuptools==75.3.0
tomli==2.2.1
tomli_w==1.0.0
```

...next let's dump them to a file and compare them with our previous
dependencies:

```console
$ dependence freeze . > dependence_after.txt
$ diff dependence_before.txt dependence_after.txt
1,5c1,5
< packaging==24.1
< pip==24.3.0
< setuptools==75.1.0
< tomli==2.1.0
< tomli_w==1.0.0
---
> packaging==24.2
> pip==24.3.1
> setuptools==75.3.0
> tomli==2.2.1
> tomli_w==1.0.1
```

As you can see above, *all* of our dependencies have been upgraded.

### Updating Requirement Specifiers

To start with, let's take a look at our pyproject.toml file:

```toml
[project]
name = "dependence"
version = "1.0.0"
dependencies = [
    "packaging>23",
    "pip",
    "setuptools>63",
    "tomli-w~=1.0",
    "tomli~=2.1",
]
```

Now that we've upgraded our dependencies, we want to update our
pyproject.toml file to align with our upgraded dependencies. This is desirable
to ensure that `dependence` isn't installed alongside a version of one of its
dependencies preceding functionality utilized by `dependence`.

```bash
dependence update pyproject.toml
```

Afterwards, our pyproject.toml file looks like this:

```toml
[project]
name = "dependence"
version = "1.0.0"
dependencies = [
    "packaging>23",
    "pip",
    "setuptools>63",
    "tomli-w~=1.0",
    "tomli~=2.2",
]
```

Here's the diff:

```console
$ diff pyproject_before.toml pyproject_after.toml
9c9
<     "tomli~=2.1",
---
>     "tomli~=2.2",
```

As you can see, only the version specifier for tomli changed. We know that
every dependency was upgraded, wo why was only the `tomli` version specifier
updated? By design. Here are the rules `dependence update` adheres to:

-   We only update requirements versions when they have *inclusive* specifiers.
    For example, `~=`, `>=`, and `<=` are inclusive, whereas `!=`, `>`, and
    `<` are *exclusive*. For this reason, nothing changed for
    "packaging" and "setuptools" in our above example.
-   We always retain the existing level of specificity. If your version
    specifier is `~=1.2`, and the new version is `1.5.6`, we're going to
    update your specifier to `~=1.5`. If your requirement has a minor version
    level of specificity, and only a patch version upgrade is performed,
    nothing will change in your project dependency specifier. This is why
    you do not see any change in our above pyproject.toml file for the
    `tomli-w` dependencyâ€”both new and old share the same minor version.
-   If your requirement is unversioned, we don't touch it, of course. This is
    why you didn't see any change for "pip".
