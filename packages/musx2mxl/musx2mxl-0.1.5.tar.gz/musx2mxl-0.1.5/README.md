## About
This project is a private initiative aimed at musicians and composers who no longer have a valid Finale license and have no other alternative than the built-in Finale export function. This converter allows users to transform **Finale (.musx) music scores** into **MusicXML (.mxl) format**, making it possible to import them into various music notation software.

**Note:** This converter currently supports only **basic notations** and does not guarantee the exact preservation of bar positions, note placements, and other advanced notations. It is still a **work in progress**.

## Usage

```
  input_path        A Finale file (*.musx) or a directory containing several Finale files.  
```

### Options:
