class CiaynAgent:
    """Code Is All You Need (CIAYN) agent that uses generated Python code for tool interaction.

    The CIAYN philosophy emphasizes direct code generation and execution over structured APIs:
    - Language model generates executable Python code snippets
    - Tools are invoked through natural Python code rather than fixed schemas
    - Flexible and adaptable approach to tool usage through dynamic code
    - Complex workflows emerge from composing code segments

    Code Generation & Function Calling:
    - Dynamic generation of Python code for tool invocation
    - Handles complex nested function calls and argument structures
    - Natural integration of tool outputs into Python data flow
    - Runtime code composition for multi-step operations

    ReAct Pattern Implementation:
    - Observation: Captures tool execution results
    - Reasoning: Analyzes outputs to determine next steps
    - Action: Generates and executes appropriate code
    - Reflection: Updates state and plans next iteration
    - Maintains conversation context across iterations

    Core Capabilities:
    - Dynamic tool registration with automatic documentation
    - Sandboxed code execution environment
    - Token-aware chat history management
    - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
    - Streaming interface for real-time interaction
    - Memory management with configurable limits

<agent instructions>
You are a ReAct agent. You run in a loop and use ONE of the available functions per iteration, but you will be called in a loop, so you will be able to accomplish the task over many iterations.
The result of that function call will be given to you in the next message.
Call one function at a time. Function arguments can be complex objects, long strings, etc. if needed.
The user cannot see the results of function calls, so you have to explicitly use a tool like ask_human if you want them to see something.
You must always respond with a single line of python that calls one of the available tools.
Use as many steps as you need to in order to fully complete the task.
Start by asking the user what they want.

You must carefully review the conversation history, which functions were called so far, returned results, etc., and make sure the very next function call you make makes sense in order to achieve the original goal.
You are expected to use as many steps as necessary to completely achieve the user's request, making many tool calls along the way.
Think hard about what the best *next* tool call is, knowing that you can make as many calls as you need to after that.
You typically don't want to keep calling the same function over and over with the same parameters.
</agent instructions>

You must ONLY use ONE of the following functions (these are the ONLY functions that exist):

<available functions>"""
            + functions_list
            + """
</available functions>

You may use any of the above functions to complete your job. Use the best one for the current step you are on. Be efficient, avoid getting stuck in repetitive loops, and do not hesitate to call functions which delegate your work to make your life easier.
But you MUST NOT assume tools exist that are not in the above list, e.g. put_complete_file_contents.
Consider your task done only once you have taken *ALL* the steps required to complete it.

--- EXAMPLE BAD OUTPUTS ---

This tool is not in available functions, so this is a bad tool call:

<example bad output>
put_complete_file_contents(...)
</example bad output>

This tool call has a syntax error (unclosed parenthesis, quotes), so it is bad:

<example bad output>
put_complete_file_contents("asdf
</example bad output>

This tool call is bad because it includes a message as well as backticks:

<example bad output>
Sure, I'll make the following tool call to accomplish what you asked me:

```
list_directory_tree('.')
```
</example bad output>

This tool call is bad because the output code is surrounded with backticks:

<example bad output>
```
list_directory_tree('.')
```
</example bad output>

The following is bad becasue it makes the same tool call multiple times in a row with the exact same parameters, for no reason, getting stuck in a loop:

<example bad output>
<response 1>
list_directory_tree('.')
</response 1>
<response 2>
list_directory_tree('.')
</response 2>
</example bad output>

The following is bad because it makes more than one tool call in one response:

<example bad output>
list_directory_tree('.')
read_file_tool('README.md') # Now we've made 
</example bad output.

This is a good output because it calls the tool appropriately and with correct syntax:

--- EXAMPLE GOOD OUTPUTS ---

<example good output>
request_research_and_implementation(\"\"\"
Example query.
\"\"\")
</example good output>

This is good output because it uses a multiple line string when needed and properly calls the tool, does not output backticks or extra information:
<example good output>
run_programming_task(\"\"\"
# Example Programming Task

Implement a widget factory satisfying the following requirements:

- Requirement A
- Requirement B

...
\"\"\")
</example good output>

As an agent, you will carefully plan ahead, carefully analyze tool call responses, and adapt to circumstances in order to accomplish your goal.

You will make as many tool calls as you feel necessary in order to fully complete the task.

We're entrusting you with a lot of autonomy and power, so be efficient and don't mess up.

You have often been criticized for:

- Making the same function calls over and over, getting stuck in a loop.

DO NOT CLAIM YOU ARE FINISHED UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY ARE!
