# What is this package about?

Codon is an open-source compiled language with Python syntax and semantics (mostly).
It works well together with python.

See:
* https://github.com/exaloop/codon
* https://docs.exaloop.io/codon

This package allows you to install Codon with:

    pip install codon-compiler-demo

In addition, you can build binary python packages with codon code.  Here is a
`setup.py` example:

    from codon_compiler_demo.setup_tools import setup, CodonExtension, BuildCodonExt

    setup(
        name='mymodule',
        version='0.1',
        packages=['mymodule'],
        ext_modules=[
            CodonExtension('mymodule', 'mymodule.codon'),
        ],
        cmdclass={'build_ext': BuildCodonExt},
        install_requires=[
            'codon_compiler_demo',
        ],
    )

# Dev status

I created this package for my own needs -- as described above.  As of now, it works
for linux only.

I don't (yet) have the expertise to build and maintain a widely-used binary
python package.  I would be very happy if anybody who needs a more mature and widely
usable codon-compiler package would take this idea over and maintain it.

If you need pointers for what I have done so far, reach out to: yaakov.belch@gmail.com
