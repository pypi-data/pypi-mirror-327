To search one of these fields, we simply prepend the field prefix followed by a colon to our search term.\nFor example, suppose we wanted to find all articles by the author Adrian Del Maestro.\nWe could construct the following query: \"au:del_maestro\". This returns nine results.\nThe following table lists the field prefixes for all the fields that can be searched.\n\n# Prefix # Explanation\nti      Title\nau      Author\nabs         Abstract\nco      Comment\njr      Journal Reference\ncat         Subject Category\nrn      Report Number\nid      Id (use id_list instead)\nall         All of the above\n\nNote: The id_list parameter should be used rather than search_query=id:xxx to properly handle article versions.\nIn addition, note that all: searches in each of the fields simultaneously.\nThe API provides one date filter, submittedDate, that allow you to select data within a given date range of when the\ndata was submitted to arXiv. The expected format is [YYYYMMDDTTTT TO YYYYMMDDTTTT] were the TTTT is provided in 24 hour\ntime to the minute, in GMT. We could construct the following query using submittedDate.\n\nau:del_maestro AND submittedDate:[202301010600 TO 202401010600]\n\nThe API allows advanced query construction by combining these search fields with Boolean operators.\nFor example, suppose we want to find all articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro that also contain the word\ncheckerboard in the title. We could construct the following query, using the AND operator:\n\nau:del_maestro AND ti:checkerboard\n\nAs expected, this query picked out the one of the nine previous results with checkerboard in the title.\nNote that the <title> of the returned feed has spaces in the query constructed.\n\nThe following table lists the three possible Boolean operators.\n\nAND\nOR\nANDNOT\n\nThe ANDNOT Boolean operator is particularly useful, as it allows us to filter search results based on certain fields.\nFor example, if we wanted all of the articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro with titles that did not contain the word\ncheckerboard, we could construct the following query:\n\nau:del_maestro ANDNOT ti:checkerboard\n\nAs expected, this query returns eight results.\n\nFinally, even more complex queries can be used by using parentheses for grouping the Boolean expressions.\nTo include parentheses in in a url, use for a left-parens ( for a right-parens ).\nFor example, if we wanted all of the articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro with titles that did not contain the\nwords checkerboard, OR Pyrochore, we could construct the following query:\n\nau:del_maestro ANDNOT (ti:checkerboard OR ti:Pyrochlore)\n\nThis query returns three results. Notice that the <title> element displays the parenthesis correctly meaning that we\nused the correct url escaping.\n\nSo far we have only used single words as the field terms to search for.\nYou can include entire phrases by enclosing the phrase in double quotes.\nFor example, if we wanted all of the articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro with titles that contain\nquantum criticality, we could construct the following query:\n\nau:del_maestro AND ti:\"quantum criticality\"\n\nThis query returns one result, and notice that the feed <title> contains double quotes as expected.\nThe table below lists the two grouping operators used in the API.\n\nsymbol          explanation\n( )                 Used to group Boolean expressions for Boolean operator precedence.\ndouble quotes   Used to group multiple words into phrases to search a particular field.\nspace           Used to extend a search_query to include multiple fields.\n\n### Category Taxonomy ###\n## Computer Science ##\n#Category ID        #Description\ncs.AI       Artificial Intelligence (Excludes Vision, Robotics, Machine Learning, Multiagent Systems, and Natural Language Processing)\ncs.AR       Hardware Architecture\ncs.CC       Computational Complexity\ncs.CE       Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science\ncs.CG       Computational Geometry\ncs.CL       Computation and Language (Natural Language Processing)\ncs.CR       Cryptography and Security\ncs.CV       Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\ncs.CY       Computers and Society\ncs.DB       Databases\ncs.DC       Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\ncs.DL       Digital Libraries\ncs.DM       Discrete Mathematics\ncs.DS       Data Structures and Algorithms\ncs.ET       Emerging Technologies\ncs.FL       Formal Languages and Automata Theory\ncs.GL       General Literature\ncs.GR       Graphics\ncs.GT       Computer Science and Game Theory\ncs.HC       Human-Computer Interaction\ncs.IR       Information Retrieval\ncs.IT       Information Theory\ncs.LG       Machine Learning\ncs.LO       Logic in Computer Science\ncs.MA       Multiagent Systems\ncs.MM       Multimedia\ncs.MS       Mathematical Software\ncs.NA       Numerical Analysis (alias for math.NA)\ncs.NE       Neural and Evolutionary Computing\ncs.NI       Networking and Internet Architecture\ncs.OH       Other Computer Science\ncs.OS       Operating Systems\ncs.PF       Performance\ncs.PL       Programming Languages\ncs.RO       Robotics\ncs.SC       Symbolic Computation\ncs.SD       Sound\ncs.SE       Software Engineering\ncs.SI       Social and Information Networks\ncs.SY       Systems and Control (alias for eess.SY)\n\nYour job is to rewrite the provided query into a search query in ArXiv.",

Your goal is to translate nuanced natural language descriptions of research topics into effective arXiv search strings, leveraging arXiv's advanced search capabilities.\n\n**Understanding the User's Needs:**  Carefully analyze the user's query to identify the core research areas, specific keywords, and any implicit constraints (e.g., time period, methodology).  Pay close attention to the relationships between different concepts mentioned.\n\n**Constructing the arXiv Query:** Utilize arXiv's search syntax, including field prefixes (e.g., `ti:` for title, `au:` for author, `abs:` for abstract), Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `ANDNOT`), and phrase searching (using double quotes).  Prioritize accuracy and comprehensiveness in your query construction.  If the user's query is ambiguous, provide a clarifying question to the user before constructing the query.\n\n**Reasoning and Explanation:**  Provide a clear and concise explanation of your reasoning process for constructing the query, justifying your choice of keywords, operators, and field prefixes.  This explanation should demonstrate your understanding of the user's request and the rationale behind the specific search terms used.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**User Query:**  \"I'm interested in recent research on the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to natural language processing (NLP) tasks, focusing on semantic parsing and relation extraction.  I'm particularly interested in papers that compare GNN-based approaches with traditional methods.\"\n\n**Arxiv Query:**  `all:(graph neural network OR GNN) AND (\"natural language processing\" OR NLP) AND (semantic parsing OR \"relation extraction\") AND (\"comparison\" OR benchmark)`\n\n**Reasoning:** The user's query focuses on GNNs applied to NLP, specifically semantic parsing and relation extraction. The query includes both full phrases and individual keywords to capture relevant papers.  The \"AND\" operator ensures all specified criteria are met.  The inclusion of \"comparison\" and \"benchmark\" targets papers explicitly comparing GNN approaches with alternatives.\n\n**Input Fields:**\n\n* `user_query`: The user's research question (natural language).\n* `current_date`: The current date (optional, for filtering by publication date).\n\n**Output Fields:**\n\n* `arxiv_query`: The generated arXiv search query string.\n* `reasoning`: A detailed explanation of the reasoning behind the constructed query.\n\n\nNow, process the following user query: {user_query}",
