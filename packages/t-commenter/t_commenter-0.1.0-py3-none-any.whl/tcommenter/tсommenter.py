"""
    The main module of the "T-COMMENTER" library is designed to create comments on tables (and other entities)
    in a database (in the current version of the library, only for PostgreSQL).

    Initially, the library was conceived as a tool for working with metadata in DAGs (DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph,
    https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html) "Apache Airflow". The need to
    rewrite the metadata of database objects arises when working with pandas, namely with "pandas.Data Frame.to_sql"
    (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html). If the method has
    the "if_exists=replace" flag, drops the table before inserting new values. In this case, all metadata is
    they are deleted along with the table. This library was created to solve this kind of problem, as well as to
    ensure the convenience of working without using SQL directly.

            It is designed to prevent SQL injections from being passed to the main query of other methods

            an instance of the class. Combines two approaches, increasing security:

                - regular expressions
                - checking for key SQL commands.

            * Description of the mechanics:

                1) Checking for allowed characters:
                The regular expression ^[a-zA-Z0-9_.\\-]+$ does not skip empty lines and other expressions do
                not match the allowed ones by throwing a ValueError exception. Only lines containing
                are allowed.
                these characters are without spaces:

                    - lowercase and uppercase Latin letters (a-z, A-Z);
                    - numbers (0-9);
                    - underline;
                    - period;
                    - hyphen.

                This allows you to use strings consisting of regular identifiers, table names, and columns.
                or other SQL parameters, but excludes inappropriate characters such as quotation marks, spaces,
                or special characters that may be part of an SQL injection.

                2) Checking for SQL key commands:
                After checking the characters, the string is additionally analyzed for reserved SQL keywords.
                words that can be used in injections. If the string contains any of the following prohibited
                For example, a ValueError exception will be thrown.:

                    - DROP;
                    - CREATE;
                    - ALTER;
                    - INSERT;
                    - UPDATE;
                    - DELETE;
                    - SQL comment "--";
                    - The command completion symbol ";".

            This prevents the use of strings containing malicious SQL constructs that can
            damage the database structure or its contents.

            *** A method for getting comments on columns by their name or by index for database entities. ***

            It is intended for receiving comments on columns of various entities, such as views |
            materialized views | ... in the database (in the current version of the library, only for PostgreSQL).

            * Description of the mechanics:

                This method uses the nested service "self._reader()". He gets "self.name_entity"
                from "__init__", as well as the "*column_index_or_name" passed by the user - the name or index of
                the required columns as values for placeholders in an SQL query. Comments on entities are stored
                in PostgreSQL service tables responsible for processing various statistics and metadata
                (tps://postgrespro.ru/docs/postgresql/14/monitoring-stats).

                Next, the response result is converted:
                either to a dictionary of the type ({'columns': {'column_name': 'comment'}}) - by default
                (service_mode=False), or if service_mode=True to the dictionary type {'column_name': 'comment'}.

                service_mode mode=True is intended to provide output data compatible with the method
                "save_comments()", in case it is necessary to overload the comments (first receive, and then your
                intermediate logic) immediately save to the same or another entity (with the same structure).
                For more information, see the description of "save_comments()".
                Important!
                If you pass both the index and the column name to the parameters together, this will cause an exception!
                The method processes there is only one type of parameter (either indexes only or column names).

                processing. The 'table' | 'columns' keys are markers for enabling specific type of processing logic
                comments on entities or their columns. Next, the method automatically determines the type of entity
                and calls the appropriate methods to save metadata.
