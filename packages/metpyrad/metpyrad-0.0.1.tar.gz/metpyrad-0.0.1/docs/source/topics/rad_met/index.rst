Overview of radionuclide metrology
==================================

**Radionuclide metrology** is a specialized field dedicated to the precise measurement and standardization of radionuclides,
which are radioactive isotopes used in various scientific, medical, and industrial applications.

This section provides an in-depth look at the **key components** of radionuclide metrology,
including the roles of National Metrology Institutes in ensuring accurate and reliable measurements,
the processes involved in radionuclide standardization, and the critical quantities that are measured.

Additionally, it explores the primary **measurement techniques** employed in this field, such as Liquid Scintillation Counting (LSC)
and the Triple-to-Double Coincidence Ratio (TDCR) method, which are essential for achieving high-precision results.
