What is MetPyRad
----------------

**MetPyRad** is an open source, GPLv3-licensed library providing a collection of tools for radionuclide metrology for the Python programming language.

MetPyRad allows processing measurements of a radionuclide using a **Hidex 300 SL** automatic liquid scintillator counter.
It is designed to facilitate the handling, analysis, and visualization of measurement data.

Main features
-------------

**MetPyRad** provides five main features for processing measurements of a radionuclide using a Hidex 300 SL automatic liquid scintillator counter:

1. **Data parsing and processing**: It includes tools to parse measurement data from CSV files, process different types of measurements (background, sample, net), and compile the results into comprehensive data structures.
2. **Measurement summarization**: It includes tools to generate detailed summaries of the measurements, including statistical analysis and cycle information.
3. **Visualization**: It includes plotting tools to visualize various quantities of the measurements, such as count rates, dead times, and uncertainties, making it easier to interpret the data.
4. **Exporting results**: It includes tools to export the processed data and visualizations to CSV and PNG files, for further analysis or reporting.
5. **Comprehensive analysis**: It supports end-to-end analysis workflows, from parsing raw data to generating summaries and visualizations, and saving the results.
