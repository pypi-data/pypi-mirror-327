"""
Transformer module for processing screw driving time series data.

This module provides a collection of scikit-learn compatible transformers
that handle various aspects of screw driving data processing:

1. Unpacking raw step data into organized measurements
2. Logging pipeline state for monitoring
3. Removing duplicate time points
4. Interpolating to achieve equidistant time series
