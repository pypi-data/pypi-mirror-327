## Overview
This dataset examines thread degradation in plastic materials through repeated fastening operations.
It was generated using an automatic screwing station from EV motor control unit assembly.
It captures the progressive wear of plastic threads over multiple fastening cycles, providing insights into material degradation patterns and failure prediction.

Collection Date: Sept. 2022

## Quick Start

```python
from pyscrew import get_data

# Load and prepare the data (returns a dictionary)
data = get_data(scenario_name="s01_thread-degradation")

# Access measurements and labels
x_values = data["torque values"] # Available: torque, angle, time, gradient, step, class
y_values = data["class values"]
```

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of three primary components:

1. `/json` directory: Contains 5,000 individual JSON files of unprocessed screw driving operations, each recording the complete measurement data of a single screwing process.
2. `labels.csv`: A metadata file that collects key information from each operation (e.g. for classification). More Details are displayed in the table below.
3. `README.md`: This readme-file providing stand-alone context for the dataset.

### Labels File Structure

The `labels.csv` contains seven columns:

| Column             | Type    | Description                                                      |
|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| run_id             | int     | Unique cycle number as recorded by the screw station             |
| file_name          | string  | Name of corresponding JSON file with the measurements            |
| class_value        | integer | Specifies the [respective class](#classification-labels-classes) |
| result_value       | string  | Operation outcome (OK/NOK) as determined by the station          |
| workpiece_id       | string  | Unique workpiece identifier (14-digit) as data matrix code       |
| workpiece_usage    | integer | Previous operations count (0-24): number of screw runs           |
| workpiece_location | integer | Screw position (0: left, 1: right)                               |

### Classification Labels (Classes)

| Value  | Name      | Amount | Description                                                   |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | Baseline  | 5000   | No additional manipulations, only wear down from repeated use |


### JSON File Structure
Each JSON file represents a complete screw driving operation with the following structure:

#### System Configuration
- `format`: Data format specification
- `node id`: System identifier
- `hardware`: Hardware model (e.g., "CS351")
- `sw version`: Software version
- `MCE factor`: Measurement calibration factor
- `max. speed`: Maximum speed capability
- `nominal torque`: System's nominal torque setting

#### Operation Parameters
- `prg name`: Program name used for the operation
- `prg date`: Program creation/modification date
- `cycle`: Operation cycle number
- `date`: Timestamp of the operation
- `id code`: Work piece identifier (14-digit DMC)
- `torque unit`: Unit of measurement for torque (Nm)
- `total time`: Total operation duration (seconds)
- `tool serial`: Tool identifier

#### Tightening Steps
Each operation consists of four tightening steps:
1. Finding
2. Thread forming
3. Pre-tightening
4. Final tightening (1.4 Nm)

Each step contains:
- `step type`: Type of tightening step
- `name`: Step identifier
- `speed`: Angular velocity (degrees/minute)
- `result`: Step outcome (OK/NOK)
- `tightening functions`: Array of control parameters including:
  - Target values (`nom`)
  - Actual values (`act`)
  - Thresholds and limits

#### Time Series Data
Each step includes detailed measurement graphs containing:
- `angle values`: Rotation angle in degrees
- `torque values`: Applied torque in Nm
- `gradient values`: Rate of change
- `time values`: Timestamp for each measurement (seconds)
- Additional monitoring values (`torqueRed`, `angleRed`)

## Data Processing

The dataset is provided raw and underwent no additional preprocessing steps.

## Experimental Setup

### Test Protocol
- Each workpiece uniquely identified via DMC
- Two test locations per workpiece (left/right)
- Maximum 25 cycles per location
- 100 unique workpieces
- 5,000 total operations
- Natural wear progression (no artificial errors)
