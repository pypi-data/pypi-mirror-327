## Overview
This dataset examines the impact of different surface conditions on screw driving operations in plastic material. It was generated using an automatic screwing station from EV motor control unit assembly.It captures the effects of various surface treatments and conditions on the fastening process. 
A total of seven different errors were recorded. The main focus of the experiment was seeing the effect that repeated screwing has on the upper work piece. Using an upper workpiece multiple times leaves residue in the contact area of the screw head and the upper workpiece, visually altering the surface structure. The goal was to deterime whether these effects alter the screwing behaviour. 

Collection Date: Jul. 2023 - Apr. 2024 *(some errors were recorded later to inspect more friction variations)*

## Quick Start

```python
from pyscrew import get_data

# Load and prepare the data (returns a dictionary)
data = get_data(scenario_name="s02_surface-friction")

# Access measurements and labels
x_values = data["torque values"] # Available: torque, angle, time, gradient, step, class
y_values = data["class values"]
```

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of three primary components:

1. `/json` directory: Contains [NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES] individual JSON files of unprocessed screw driving operations, each recording the complete measurement data of a single screwing process.
2. `labels.csv`: A metadata file that collects key information from each operation (e.g. for classification). More Details are displayed in the table below.
3. `README.md`: This readme-file providing stand-alone context for the dataset.

### Labels File Structure

- Torque-angle relationship evolution
- Multi-class classification for specific error types
- Clustering-based approaches to identify similar cause-effect-relationships
