# SurfTrack

This repository contains scripts for tracking and analyzing versatile images from in-situ optical microscopy (OM) experiment or Blood Clotting experiments.

## Overview

The project aims to develop a package for tracking and analyzing any images from a movie. It involves two main MATLAB scripts: `trracking_master_code.m` and `Tracked_surface_compare.m`.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2022a or later
- MATLAB Computer Vision Toolbox
- Python 3.x

## Setup

### Installation
1. **Download the Package:**
   - Download the zip file containing the SurfTrack package.
   - Extract the zip file to a directory of your choice.

2. **Install the Package:**
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you extracted the package.
   - Install the package by running the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MusannaGalib/SurfTrack.git
cd SurfTrack
pip install .
```
   This command installs the package along with its dependencies.

   SurfTrack can also be installed from PyPI:
```bash
pip install SurfTrack
```

### Using the Package

To use this package, give your matlab executable path in ```run.py```. Then just copy your movie.mp4 file in the scirpts folder and run the following command 

```python
process = subprocess.Popen(['C:/Program Files/MATLAB/R2022a/bin/matlab', '-nosplash', '-nodesktop', '-r', f"run('{script_path}');exit;"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
```


```python

python3 wrapper.py

```

If you want to change the number of images that needed to be generated from the movie change the following file in the ```run.py``` file:
```python

# Define how many images you want from the video
npics = 3
```

### Example Usage

An example movie is given in 'scripts' folder. You can use the following commands to play with that.

```python
# execute the python wrapper
python3 wrapper.py
```
