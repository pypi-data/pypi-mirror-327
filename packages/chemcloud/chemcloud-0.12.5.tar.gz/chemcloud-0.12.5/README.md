# chemcloud - A Python Client for ChemCloud

`chemcloud` is a python client for the [ChemCloud Server](https://github.com/mtzgroup/chemcloud-server). The client provides a simple yet powerful interface to perform computational chemistry calculations using nothing but modern Python and an internet connection.

**Documentation**: <https://mtzgroup.github.io/chemcloud-client>

`chemcloud` works in harmony with a suite of other quantum chemistry tools for fast, structured, and interoperable quantum chemistry.

## The QC Suite of Programs

- [qcio](https://github.com/coltonbh/qcio) - Elegant and intuitive data structures for quantum chemistry, featuring seamless Jupyter Notebook visualizations. [Documentation](https://qcio.coltonhicks.com)
- [qcparse](https://github.com/coltonbh/qcparse) - A library for efficient parsing of quantum chemistry data into structured `qcio` objects.
- [qcop](https://github.com/coltonbh/qcop) - A package for operating quantum chemistry programs using `qcio` standardized data structures. Compatible with `TeraChem`, `psi4`, `QChem`, `NWChem`, `ORCA`, `Molpro`, `geomeTRIC`, and many more, featuring seamless Jupyter Notebook visualizations.
- [BigChem](https://github.com/mtzgroup/bigchem) - A distributed application for running quantum chemistry calculations at scale across clusters of computers or the cloud. Bring multi-node scaling to your favorite quantum chemistry program, featuring seamless Jupyter Notebook visualizations.
- `ChemCloud` - A [web application](https://github.com/mtzgroup/chemcloud-server) and associated [Python client](https://github.com/mtzgroup/chemcloud-client) for exposing a BigChem cluster securely over the internet, featuring seamless Jupyter Notebook visualizations.

## Installation

```sh
pip install chemcloud
```

## Quickstart

- Create a ChemCloud account at [https://chemcloud.mtzlab.com/signup](https://chemcloud.mtzlab.com/signup) (or the address of the ChemCloud Server you want to communicate with).
- Instantiate a client
- Configure client (only required the very first time you use `CCClient`)

```python
from chemcloud import CCClient

client = CCClient()
client.configure() # only run this the very first time you use CCClient
# See supported compute engines on the ChemCloud Server
client.supported_engines
['psi4', 'terachem', ...]
# Test connection to ChemCloud
client.hello_world("Colton")
'Welcome to ChemCloud, Colton'
```

- Run calculations just like you would with `qcop` except calling `client.compute` instead of `qcop.compute`. Rather than getting back an `Output` object directly, `client.compute` returns a `FutureOutput` object which can be used to get the output of the computation once it is complete.

```python
from qcio import Structure, ProgramInput
from chemcloud import CCClient

client = CCClient()

# Create the structure
h2o = Structure.open("h2o.xyz")

# Define the program input
prog_input = ProgramInput(
    structure=h2o,
    calctype="energy",
    model={"method": "hf", "basis": "sto-3g"},
    keywords={"purify": "no", "restricted": False},
)

# Submit the calculation to the server
future_output = client.compute("terachem", prog_input, collect_files=True)
# Status can be checked at any time
future_result.status
# Get the output (blocking)
output = future_output.get()

# Inspect the output
output.input_data # Input data used by the QC program
output.success # Whether the calculation succeeded
output.results # All structured results from the calculation
output.stdout # Stdout log from the calculation
output.pstdout # Shortcut to print out the stdout in human readable format
output.files # Any files returned by the calculation
output.provenance # Provenance information about the calculation
output.extras # Any extra information not in the schema
output.traceback # Stack trace if calculation failed
output.ptraceback # Shortcut to print out the traceback in human readable format
```

## Examples

Examples of various computations can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/mtzgroup/chemcloud-client/tree/main/examples).

## ✨ Visualization ✨

Visualize all your results with a single line of code!

First install the visualization module:

```sh
pip install qcio[view]
```

or if your shell requires `''` around arguments with brackets:

```sh
pip install 'qcio[view]'
```

Then in a Jupyter notebook import the `qcio` view module and call `view.view(...)` passing it one or any number of `qcio` objects you want to visualizing including `Structure` objects or any `ProgramOutput` object. You may also pass an array of `titles` and/or `subtitles` to add additional information to the molecular structure display. If no titles are passed `qcio` with look for `Structure` identifiers such as a name or SMILES to label the `Structure`.

Seamless visualizations for `ProgramOutput` objects make results analysis easy!

![Optimization Viewer](https://public.coltonhicks.com/assets/qcio/optimization_viewer.png)

Single point calculations display their results in a table.

If you want to use the HTML generated by the viewer to build your own dashboards use the functions inside of `qcio.view.py` that begin with the word `generate_` to create HTML you can insert into any dashboard.
