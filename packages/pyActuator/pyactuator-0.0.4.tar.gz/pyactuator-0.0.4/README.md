# pyActuator

## Introduction

pyActuator enables customer software development in Python using our [orcaSDK](https://github.com/IrisDynamics/orcaSDK). It serves as a wrapper around our C++ SDK, rather than a standalone Python implementation. For more information, [visit our documentation](https://github.com/IrisDynamics/orcaSDK/blob/main/README.md).
