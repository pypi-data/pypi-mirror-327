Observable to measure the probabilities of the final state of the MPS

class TNObsProbabilities(_TNObsBase):
    r"""
    Observable to measure the probabilities of the state configurations
    at the end of an evolution. The probabilities are computed following
    a probability tree, where each node is a site, and has a number of
    childs equal to the local dimension :math:`d` of the site. We keep
    track of the probabilities of the paths from the root to the leaves.
    The leaves identify the final state. For example, a state written as

    .. math::
        |\psi\rangle = \sqrt{N}\left(|00\rangle + |01\rangle
        + 2|11\rangle\right)

    with :math:`N=\frac{1}{6}` will have the following
    probability tree. Branches going left measures :math:`0` while
    branches on the right measures :math:`1`. The ordering here is
    the right-most site being the index-0 site.

    .. code-block::

                   ----o----             # No measure, state s2,s1
            p=1/6/            \p=5/6     # First measure, states s2,0 or s2,1
                o              o
         p=1/6/   \p=0  p=1/6/   \p=4/6  # Second measure, states 0,0 or 0,1 or 1,1
             00   10        01   11

    There are three possible ways of computing the probability:

    - Going down **evenly** on the tree, which means following ALL possible paths
      at the same time, and discarding paths which probability is below an input
      threshold :math:`\epsilon`. You might have no outputs, if all the branches
      has a probability :math:`p<\epsilon`.
    - Going down **greedily** on the tree, which means following each time the path
      with highest probability, until the total probability measured is more then
      a threshold :math:`\mathcal{E}`. This procedure is dangerous, since it can
      take an exponentially-long time if :math:`\mathcal{E}` is too high.
    - Going down **unbiasedly** on the tree, which means drawing a ``num_sumples``
      uniformly distributed random numbers :math:`u\sim U(0,1)` and ending in the
      leaf which probability interval :math:`[p_{\mathrm{low}}, p_{\mathrm{high}}]`
      is such that :math:`u\in [p_{\mathrm{low}}, p_{\mathrm{high}}]`. This is the
      suggested method. See http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10330 for additional details.

    The result of the observable will be a dictionary where:

    - the keys are the measured state on a given basis
    - the values are the probabilities of measuring the key for the **even** and
      **greedy** approach, while they are the probability intervals for the
      **unbiased** approach.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prob_type: str, optional
        The type of probability measure. Default to 'U'. Available:
        - 'U', unbiased
        - 'G', greedy
        - 'E', even. Also implemented in Fortran backend
    num_samples: int, optional
        Number of samples for the unbiased prob_type. Default to 100.
        If a list is passed, the function is called multiple times with that list of
        parameters.
    prob_threshold: float, optional
        probability treshold for `prob_type=('G', 'E')`. Default to 0.9.
    qiskit_convention : bool, optional
        If you should use the qiskit convention when measuring, i.e. least significant qubit
        on the right. Default to False.
