# Explain Package Structure and Architecture
 
I need a comprehensive analysis of the package structure and architecture. Please analyze the following codebase using industry-standard architectural principles.

Please provide a detailed analysis following this structure:
1. System Context (C4 Level 1):
   - Overall system purpose and boundaries
   - External dependencies and integrations
   - Key stakeholders and users

2. Container Analysis (C4 Level 2):
   - Major system components/services
   - Communication patterns between containers
   - Data flow architecture
   - Technology stack overview

3. Component Deep Dive (C4 Level 3):
   - Detailed package hierarchy
   - Component responsibilities and interactions
   - Key abstractions and interfaces
   - Dependency management approach
   - Entry points and core services
  
4. Architecture Quality Analysis:
   - SOLID principles adherence
   - Coupling and cohesion assessment
   - Scalability considerations
   - Maintainability metrics
   - Technical debt identification
   - Security architecture review

5. Architectural Patterns & Decisions:
   - Identified design patterns
   - Key architectural decisions (ADRs)
   - Trade-offs and justifications
   - Alternative approaches considered
   - Future scalability provisions
 
6. Visualization Requirements:
   - System context diagram
   - Container diagram
   - Component diagram
   - Package dependency graph
   - Data flow visualization
 
7. Documentation Recommendations:
   - Architecture documentation gaps
   - Suggested documentation improvements
   - Key areas requiring clarification
   - Maintenance guidelines

**Analysis Guidelines:**
1. Follow C4 model hierarchy for systematic analysis
2. Use industry-standard terminology
3. Provide concrete examples for patterns
4. Include metrics where applicable
5. Consider both functional and non-functional aspects
6. Document assumptions and constraints
7. Highlight potential risks and mitigations
 
**Visualization Guidelines:**
1. Use proper UML notation where applicable
2. Include legend/key for all diagrams
3. Maintain consistent visual hierarchy
4. Use color coding for different concerns
5. Show both static and dynamic relationships
 
If you need additional information about specific architectural aspects or require clarification about certain components, please ask.
 
Note: Please ensure all diagrams are generated using the graphviz syntax for consistency and clarity.
