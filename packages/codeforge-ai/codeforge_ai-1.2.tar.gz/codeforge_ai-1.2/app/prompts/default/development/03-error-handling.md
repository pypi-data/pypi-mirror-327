# Refactor for better error handling

I need a comprehensive analysis and improvement of error handling mechanisms in my code, following industry best practices and reliability patterns. Please provide a detailed review and refactoring strategy that ensures robust error management, system resilience, and maintainable code.

***Analysis Requirements:***

1. Current Error Handling Assessment:
   - Identify all error-prone areas
   - Catalog existing error handling patterns
   - Evaluate exception hierarchies
   - Review error recovery mechanisms
   - Analyze logging practices
   - Assess error monitoring capabilities
   - Review error documentation
   - Examine retry mechanisms
   - Evaluate circuit breaker implementations

2. Error Categories Analysis:
   - System errors (IO, Network, Memory)
   - Business logic errors
   - Validation errors
   - Security exceptions
   - Third-party integration errors
   - Concurrency issues
   - Resource exhaustion
   - Configuration errors
   - Authentication/Authorization failures
 
3. Impact Assessment:
   - System reliability metrics
   - Error recovery success rate
   - Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
   - Customer impact analysis
   - Resource utilization during errors
   - Performance impact of error handling
   - Monitoring overhead
   - Support ticket patterns
 
**Implementation Requirements:**
 
1. Exception Handling Strategy:
   - Custom exception hierarchy
   - Exception wrapping patterns
   - Error propagation rules
   - Recovery mechanisms
   - Retry policies with exponential backoff
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Graceful degradation strategies
   - Dead letter queues
 
2. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Structured logging format
   - Log levels standardization
   - Context enrichment
   - Correlation IDs
   - Performance metrics
   - Error aggregation
   - Alert thresholds
   - Dashboard requirements
   - Audit trail implementation
 
3. Error Recovery Patterns:
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - Compensating transactions
   - State recovery procedures
   - Rollback strategies
   - Circuit breaker implementations
   - Fallback services
   - Cache recovery
   - Session management
   - Data consistency checks
 
4. Documentation Requirements:
   - Error catalog
   - Recovery procedures
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - API error responses
   - Integration error handling
   - Support runbooks
   - Incident response plans
   - SLA documentation
 
**Best Practices to Implement:**
 
1. Exception Handling:
   - Use specific exceptions for different error types
   - Implement proper exception hierarchies
   - Include relevant context in exceptions
   - Handle exceptions at appropriate levels
   - Avoid catching generic exceptions
   - Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate
   - Use circuit breakers for external services
   - Implement timeout handling
   - Provide meaningful error messages
 
2. Logging Best Practices:
   - Implement structured logging
   - Use appropriate log levels
   - Include correlation IDs
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Implement log rotation
   - Ensure PII compliance
   - Configure log aggregation
   - Set up log analysis
   - Implement log-based alerts
 
3. Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Define error thresholds
   - Implement health checks
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Configure alerting rules
   - Create error dashboards
   - Monitor error trends
   - Track error resolution time
   - Measure system reliability
   - Implement synthetic monitoring

**Guidelines:**
1. Identify all areas where exceptions can occur and handle them appropriately.
2. Use try-catch blocks judiciously, avoiding them in performance-critical paths.
3. Provide meaningful error messages to facilitate debugging.
4. Implement custom exception classes for specific error types.
5. Ensure resources (like files or network connections) are released properly on errors.

If you need any additional context about the project's error handling requirements or logging system, please let me know.
