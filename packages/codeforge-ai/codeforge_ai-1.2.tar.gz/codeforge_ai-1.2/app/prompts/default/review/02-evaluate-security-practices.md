# Evaluate Security Practices

I need a comprehensive security audit of my code following industry best practices (OWASP, SANS, CWE) and compliance standards. Please provide a detailed analysis of security vulnerabilities, risks, and recommended mitigations.


***Security Analysis Requirements:***
 
1. Input Validation & Data Sanitization:
   - SQL Injection prevention
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection
   - Command Injection safeguards
   - Path Traversal prevention
   - Input boundary validation

   - Character encoding handling
   - File upload security

2. Authentication & Authorization:
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Password handling practices
   - Session management
   - JWT implementation
   - OAuth/OIDC implementation
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Principle of the least privilege
   - API authentication

3. Data Protection:
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Key management
   - Sensitive data handling
   - PII protection
   - Secure storage practices
   - Data masking
   - Backup security

4. Error Handling & Logging:
   - Secure error messages
   - Error logging practices
   - Log injection prevention
   - Sensitive data in logs
   - Audit logging
   - Log retention policies

   - Log integrity
 
5. API Security:
   - Rate limiting
   - API versioning
   - Request validation
   - Response security headers
   - CORS configuration
   - API documentation security
   - GraphQL security (if applicable)
   - API gateway security
 
6. Dependency Security:
   - Third-party library audit
   - Known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
   - Dependency update strategy
   - License compliance
   - Supply chain security
   - Container security
   - Runtime dependency checks
   - Dependency isolation
 
7. Cryptographic Practices:
   - Algorithm selection
   - Key generation
   - Random number generation
   - Hash functions
   - Digital signatures
   - Certificate handling
   - TLS configuration
   - Crypto library usage

   - Security debt assessment
 
2. Vulnerability Report:
   - Identified vulnerabilities
   - CVSS scores
   - Attack vectors
   - Impact assessment
   - Exploitation difficulty
   - Affected components
   - Root cause analysis
   - Mitigation status
 
3. Remediation Plan:
   - Prioritized fixes
   - Quick wins
   - Long-term improvements
   - Resource requirements
   - Timeline estimates
   - Testing requirements
   - Validation steps
   - Rollback procedures
 
4. Security Best Practices:
