# Eliminate code duplication

I need help identifying and eliminating code duplication to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt. Please analyze the code and provide a comprehensive refactoring strategy.

***Analysis Requirements***

1. Code Duplication Analysis:
   - Identify exact code duplicates
   - Detect similar code patterns with minor variations
   - Find duplicated business logic across different layers
   - Locate repeated validation or error handling patterns
   - Highlight duplicated configurations or constants
 
2. Impact Assessment:
   - Maintenance cost of current duplication
   - Risk analysis of inconsistent changes
   - Technical debt evaluation
   - Performance implications
   - Testing complexity due to duplication

3. Refactoring Recommendations:
   - Extract common functionality into reusable methods/classes
   - Implement appropriate design patterns
   - Create shared utility functions
   - Establish base classes for common behavior
   - Introduce interfaces for consistent contracts

4. Implementation Strategy:
   - Step-by-step refactoring plan
   - Priority order for changes
   - Risk mitigation steps
   - Testing approach for refactored code
   - Backward compatibility considerations

***Best Practices to Apply***
1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
   - Extract shared logic into reusable components
   - Create common interfaces for similar behaviors
   - Implement template methods for similar processes
   - Use inheritance and composition effectively
   - Leverage dependency injection for shared services

2. SOLID Principles:
   - Single Responsibility Principle for extracted code
   - Open/Closed Principle for extensions
   - Liskov Substitution for inheritance hierarchies
   - Interface Segregation for clean contracts
   - Dependency Inversion for flexible architecture
 
3. Design Patterns:
   - Template Method for similar algorithms
   - Strategy Pattern for interchangeable behaviors
   - Factory Pattern for object creation
   - Decorator Pattern for extending functionality
   - Command Pattern for operation encapsulation
 
4. Code Organization:
   - Logical grouping of related functionality
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Consistent file structure
   - Proper package organization
   - Documentation of shared components

***Deliverables***
 
1. Analysis Report:
   - Identified duplication patterns
   - Impact assessment metrics
   - Risk evaluation
   - Technical debt calculation
 
2. Refactoring Plan:
   - Prioritized list of changes
   - Implementation timeline
   - Testing requirements
   - Migration strategy
 
3. Code Examples:
   - Before/After comparisons
   - Design pattern implementations
   - Utility function examples
   - Base class structures
 
4. Documentation:
   - Usage guidelines for new components
   - API documentation
   - Migration guides
   - Testing requirements

If you need any additional context about the project structure or related files, please let me know.
