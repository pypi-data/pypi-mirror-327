# Improve readability and maintainability

I want to improve the readability and maintainability of my code. Can you review and suggest refactoring for the following class/file?




Please provide the following in your analysis:

1. Identify areas where readability can be improved.
2. Suggest refactoring to enhance maintainability.
3. Provide specific code examples for the suggested improvements.
4. Explain how these changes will make the code more readable and maintainable.

**Guidelines:**
1. Use meaningful variable and function names that convey their purpose.
2. Break down large functions into smaller, single-responsibility functions.
3. Maintain consistent indentation and formatting throughout the codebase.
4. Add comments and documentation to clarify complex logic.
5. Follow established style guides (like PEP 8 for Python) for consistency.

If you need any additional context about the code or its purpose, please let me know.
