# Eliminate code duplication

I need help eliminating code duplication in my project. Can you review and suggest refactoring for the following class/file?




Please provide the following in your analysis:

1. Identify any duplicated code segments within this file.
2. Suggest ways to refactor the duplicated code to follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
3. Provide specific code examples for the suggested refactoring.
4. Explain how these changes will improve code maintainability and reduce duplication.

**Guidelines:**
1. Search for duplicate code blocks or similar logic across functions.
2. Extract common functionality into utility functions or base classes.
3. Use inheritance or composition to share code where appropriate.
4. Ensure the extracted code is well-tested to prevent introducing bugs.

If you need any additional context about the project structure or related files, please let me know.
