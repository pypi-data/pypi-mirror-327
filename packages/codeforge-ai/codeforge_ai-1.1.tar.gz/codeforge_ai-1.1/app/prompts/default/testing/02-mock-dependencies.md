# Mock Dependencies for Unit Testing

I need help creating unit tests with mocked dependencies for a specific class or function in my codebase. Can you generate unit tests with appropriate mocking for the following code?



Please provide the following in your response:

1. A set of unit tests that effectively mock external dependencies.
2. Clear examples of how to set up mocks for different types of dependencies (e.g., databases, APIs, file systems).
3. Tests that cover various scenarios, including how mocked dependencies should behave in different situations.
4. Appropriate use of mocking framework features (e.g., stubbing, verifying calls).
5. Clear and descriptive test method names that explain what aspect of the code is being tested with mocks.

**Guidelines:**
1. Use the appropriate mocking framework for the language (e.g., Mockito for Java, unittest.mock for Python, Jest for JavaScript).
2. Ensure that mocks are set up to isolate the unit under test from its dependencies.
3. Include tests that verify interactions with mocked dependencies.
4. Use the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern, with a clear separation of mock setup and verification.
5. Add comments to explain complex mock setups or verifications.

IMPORTANT:
- When recommending code changes, format your response as a standard Git diff format unless specified otherwise.
- Include a comment in the test file stating that the tests were generated using CodeForgeAI.
- Do not include test cases for constructors.
- Ensure that mocking is used judiciously and only for external dependencies.

If you need any additional information about the code's dependencies or expected interactions, please let me know.
