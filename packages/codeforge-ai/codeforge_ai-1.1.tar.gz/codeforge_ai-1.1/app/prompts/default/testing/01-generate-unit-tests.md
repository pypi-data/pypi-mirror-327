# Generate Unit Tests

I need help creating unit tests for a class or method in my codebase. Can you generate comprehensive unit tests for the following code?



Please provide the following in your response:

1. A complete set of unit tests for the specified class or method.
2. Tests that cover various scenarios, including edge cases and potential error conditions.
3. Appropriate use of the language-specific testing framework and assertions.
4. Mocking of dependencies where necessary using the appropriate mocking framework.
5. Clear and descriptive test method names that explain what is being tested.

**Guidelines:**
1. Ensure 100% code coverage for the given class or method.
2. Use the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern for structuring each test.
3. Include both positive and negative test cases.
4. Include tests for edge cases and boundary conditions.
5. Use meaningful test data that reflects real-world scenarios.
6. Add comments to explain complex test setups or assertions.

IMPORTANT:
- When recommending code changes, format your response as a standard Git diff format unless specified otherwise.
- Include a comment in the test class stating that the tests were generated using CodeForgeAI.
- Do not include test cases for constructors.
- Coverage: Estimate the coverage for the class/function and provide the total coverage %.

If you need any additional information about the code or its dependencies, please let me know.
