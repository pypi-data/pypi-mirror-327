# Check for Unused Code

I want to clean up my codebase by removing unused code. Can you review the following class/file and identify any unused elements?




Please provide the following in your analysis:

1. Identify any unused variables within the file.
2. List any functions or methods that are defined but never called.
3. Detect any unused imports or dependencies.
4. Suggest how to safely remove or refactor the unused code.
5. Recommend tools or techniques for automatically detecting unused code in the future.
6. Provide any insights on potential side effects of removing the identified unused code.

If you need any additional context about the project structure or how this file interacts with other parts of the codebase, please let me know.
