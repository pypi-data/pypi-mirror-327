# Use Java Streams Instead of Nested For Loops

I want to optimize my Java code by replacing nested for loops with streams. Can you review the following class/file and suggest improvements?



Please provide the following in your analysis:

1. Identify any nested for loops in the code that could be replaced with Java streams.
2. Suggest refactoring to use Java streams for improved readability and efficiency.
3. Provide specific code examples of how to implement the changes using streams.
4. Discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of using streams in this context.
5. Highlight any scenarios where traditional for loops might still be preferable to streams.
6. Offer any additional tips for effective use of Java streams in this code.

If you need any additional context about the code's functionality or performance requirements, please let me know.
