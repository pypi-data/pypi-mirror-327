# Assess Error Handling

I want to improve the error handling in my code. Can you review the following class/file and provide suggestions?



Please assess the following aspects and provide recommendations:

1. Evaluate the current error handling mechanisms in place.
2. Identify any areas where exceptions are not being caught or handled properly.
3. Assess whether the error messages are informative and user-friendly.
4. Suggest improvements for logging errors and providing debugging information.
5. Recommend best practices for error handling that could be applied to this code.
6. Provide examples of how to implement more robust error handling where necessary.

If you need any additional information about the project's error handling requirements or logging system, please ask.
