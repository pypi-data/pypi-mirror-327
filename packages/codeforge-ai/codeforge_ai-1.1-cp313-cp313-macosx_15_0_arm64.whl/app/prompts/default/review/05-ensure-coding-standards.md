# Ensure Adherence to Coding Standards

I want to ensure my code adheres to established coding standards and style guides. Can you review the following class/file and provide feedback?




Please assess the following aspects and provide recommendations:

1. Check for compliance with common coding standards and best practices for the specified programming language.
2. Identify any violations of style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google Style Guide for Java, etc.).
3. Evaluate the consistency of coding style throughout the file.
4. Suggest improvements for naming conventions, formatting, and organization.
5. Recommend any tools or linters that could help maintain coding standards in the future.
6. Provide specific examples of how to correct any identified issues.

If you need any additional information about project-specific coding standards or style preferences, please let me know.
