# Check for Code Duplication

I need help identifying and reducing code duplication in my project. Can you review the following class/file and suggest improvements?



Please provide the following in your analysis:

1. Identify any duplicated code segments within this file.
2. Check for similar code patterns that might exist in other parts of the codebase.
3. Suggest ways to refactor the duplicated code into reusable functions or modules.
4. Recommend appropriate design patterns or principles that could help reduce duplication.
5. Provide specific code examples of how the refactoring could be implemented.

If you need any additional context about the project structure or related files, please let me know.
