# Document Project Architecture
 
I need help creating documentation for my project's architecture. Can you help generate comprehensive architecture documentation?
 

 
Please provide the following in the documentation:
 
1. System Overview
   - High-level architecture
   - Key components and their relationships
   - Technology stack
 
2. Component Documentation
   - Purpose and responsibility of each component
   - Interactions between components
   - Data flow diagrams
 
3. Technical Decisions
   - Architecture decisions and rationale
   - Design patterns used
   - Trade-offs considered
 
4. Deployment Architecture
   - Infrastructure requirements
   - Deployment process
   - Scaling considerations
 
**Guidelines:**
1. Use architecture diagrams (C4 model recommended)
2. Include sequence diagrams for complex flows
3. Document system boundaries and interfaces
4. Explain architectural decisions
5. Include performance considerations
 
If you need any additional information about the project to document the architecture, please ask.
