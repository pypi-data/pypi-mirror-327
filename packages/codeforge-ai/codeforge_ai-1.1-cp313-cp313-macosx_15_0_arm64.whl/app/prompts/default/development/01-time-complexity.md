# Optimize code to reduce time complexity

I need help optimizing the time complexity of my code. Can you review and suggest improvements for the following class/file?



Please provide the following in your analysis:

1. Identify the current time complexity of key algorithms or functions.
2. Suggest optimizations to reduce the time complexity.
3. Provide specific code examples or pseudocode for the suggested improvements.
4. Explain the expected impact of these optimizations on performance.

**Guidelines:**
1. Analyze the current algorithm's time complexity to identify bottlenecks.
2. Look for nested loops that can be reduced or eliminated.
3. Consider using more efficient data structures (e.g., hash tables, trees) for faster access.
4. Review algorithm alternatives (e.g., use quicksort instead of bubble sort).
5. Implement memoization or dynamic programming for overlapping sub-problems.

If you need any additional context about the code or its usage, please let me know.
