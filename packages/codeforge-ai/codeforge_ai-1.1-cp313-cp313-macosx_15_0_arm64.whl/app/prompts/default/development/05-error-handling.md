# Refactor for better error handling

I need to improve the error handling in my code. Can you review and suggest refactoring for the following class/file?




Please provide the following in your analysis:

1. Identify areas where error handling can be improved.
2. Suggest refactoring to enhance error handling and follow best practices.
3. Provide specific code examples for the suggested improvements.
4. Explain how these changes will make the code more robust and maintainable.

**Guidelines:**
1. Identify all areas where exceptions can occur and handle them appropriately.
2. Use try-catch blocks judiciously, avoiding them in performance-critical paths.
3. Provide meaningful error messages to facilitate debugging.
4. Implement custom exception classes for specific error types.
5. Ensure resources (like files or network connections) are released properly on errors.

If you need any additional context about the project's error handling requirements or logging system, please let me know.
