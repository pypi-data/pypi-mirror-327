# Increase test coverage and quality

I want to improve the test coverage and quality of my code. Can you review and suggest improvements for the following class/file?




Please provide the following in your analysis:

1. Identify areas where test coverage is lacking or can be improved.
2. Suggest new test cases or improvements to existing tests.
3. Provide specific code examples for the suggested test improvements.
4. Estimate the potential increase in test coverage after implementing these changes.

**Guidelines:**
1. Review existing tests to identify gaps in coverage.
2. Write unit tests for new functionalities and edge cases.
3. Use mocking frameworks to isolate dependencies in unit tests.
4. Refactor tests for clarity and reduce complexity where necessary.
5. Consider implementing test-driven development (TDD) for new features.

If you need any additional information about the project's testing framework or specific testing requirements, please ask.
