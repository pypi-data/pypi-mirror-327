# Enhance code modularity

I want to improve the modularity of my code and enhance separation of concerns. Can you review and suggest refactoring for the following class/file?




Please provide the following in your analysis:

1. Identify areas where modularity can be improved.
2. Suggest refactoring to enhance separation of concerns.
3. Provide specific code examples for the suggested improvements.
4. Explain how these changes will make the code more modular and maintainable.

**Guidelines:**
1. Organize code into modules or classes based on functionality.
2. Define clear interfaces between modules to reduce coupling.
3. Consider using design patterns (like MVC or Observer) to promote modularity.
4. Ensure each module has a single responsibility to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

If you need any additional context about the project structure or architecture, please let me know.
