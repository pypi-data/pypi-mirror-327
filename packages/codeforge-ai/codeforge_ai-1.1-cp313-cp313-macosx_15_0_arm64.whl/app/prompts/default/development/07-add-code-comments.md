# Add Code Comments
 
I need help adding comprehensive comments to my code. Can you review and suggest comments for the following class/file?
 

 
Please provide the following in your analysis:
 
1. Add file-level documentation explaining the overall purpose and functionality.
2. Add class-level documentation including:
   - Class purpose and responsibilities
   - Important class relationships
   - Usage examples if applicable
3. Add method-level documentation covering:
   - Method purpose
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return value descriptions
   - Exceptions thrown
   - Usage examples for complex methods
4. Add inline comments for:
   - Complex algorithms
   - Business logic
   - Non-obvious implementation details
   - Important warning or notes
 
**Guidelines:**
1. Follow language-specific documentation standards (e.g., JSDoc, docstring).
2. Keep comments clear, concise, and meaningful.
3. Avoid obvious comments that merely restate the code.
4. Include examples for complex functionality.
5. Document assumptions and edge cases.
6. Add TODO comments for future improvements if necessary.
